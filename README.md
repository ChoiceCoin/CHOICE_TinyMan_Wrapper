# CHOICE_TinyMan_Wrapper
A wrapper that allows users to acquire Choice Coin directly through their Terminal using ALGO and various Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs). This wrapper leverages the TinyMan Python SDK.

First, make sure that you have Python installed and a virtual environment configured. Download Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/, and read about creating a new virtual environment here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html. 

1. To use, download the contents of the *Choice_SDK.py* file and the contents of the *requirements.txt* file. 
2. Next, with your virtual environment active, run the following command: *pip install requirements.txt*.
3. Insert your address and mnemonic in the appropriate places in the *Choice_SDK.py* file.
4. Run the script using *python Choice_SDK.py* command on your terminal with the virtual environment active.
